This project is a rebranding of Ignite Seattle (http://www.igniteseattle.com). I used HTML/CSS + Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, and used the wonderful Codekit for development and Sass compiling. This project is desktop and mobile-friendly and was done for the course HCDE 508: Visual Communication at the University of Washington.

<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
I used inspiration from TED (obviously), and went for bold messaging, and made the black/red/white color palette more prominent. 
<h4>Problem:</h4>
The current Ignite Seattle website is in a blog format, and uses Wordpress. Because of the theme they use which just lists posts in chronological order, the brand value is diminished because users have no messaging about what Ignite does, and their are no clear call to actions to engage the user and ultimately get the user to interact with the site/support the organization. I made call to actions a central aspect of my design (registering for events, watching videos), and aimed for a cohesive brand by increasing use of their color palette.
