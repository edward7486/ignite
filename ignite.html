		<h1>NEXT EVENT: MAY 20, 2015</h1>
		<p>Ignite Seattle 27, on May 20th 2015 will be the first time we’re going to have a theme for the evening. What’s a theme, you ask? Good question. What we want to do is an experiment. All previous Ignites have been a potpourri of topics, ideas, styles and attitudes. What would an evening of talks focused on a theme be like? Better? Worse? We want to learn. And it’s only fitting for our first themed Ignite that we pick the theme of EXPERIMENTS! An experiment is when you do something with the goal of verifying, refuting, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. In other words, choosing to act fully aware you don’t know what’s going to happen.</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Ignite is an evening of fast paced talks on a wide range of interesting subjects, first held in Seattle in 2006. The first event was organized by Brady Forrest and Bre Pettis, inspired in part by a desire to simplify Pecha Kucha to a 5 minute format.</p>
			<p>There have been 26 Ignite Seattle events and they are currently held at the wonderful Town Hall Seattle. Many other cities also run Ignite events.</p>
